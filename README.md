# Distributed-Databases

The project involves implementing following key concepts in distributed and parallel databases systems:

1. Data fragmentation across partitions (Database Sharding)
2. Query processor that accesses data from the partitioned table
3. Parallel sort and parallel join algorithm.

These concepts were built upon open source relational database PostreSQL & python programming language and psycopg used as database driver for PostreSQL.

Technologies: Python, PostreSQL, psycopg
